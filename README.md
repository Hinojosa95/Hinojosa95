<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bryan Hinojosa</h1>

<h3 align="justify">Goals and Objectives

My main goal is to continue growing as a data science and analytics professional, applying my knowledge to create real value for companies and support strategic decision-making. I aim to establish myself in a role where I can combine my background in sales and customer service with my analytical skills, delivering data-driven solutions to real-world challenges. I'm also committed to ongoing learning, with a focus on SQL, Python, data visualization tools, and web application deployment platforms like Streamlit. In the medium term, Iâ€™m interested in launching my own tech venture and scaling my current tire-selling business by integrating digital solutions that boost its growth.

Career and Achievements

I hold a degree in Criminology and Criminalistics, which has given me a structured and analytical approach to problem-solving. I have built solid experience in sales and customer service, and Iâ€™m currently enhancing my technical skill set through a Data Science bootcamp at TripleTen, which I started in 2024 and am set to complete in about a month. Throughout the program, Iâ€™ve been working on hands-on projects involving data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, applied to industries such as gaming, mining, and automotive. Iâ€™m also currently working as an appointment setter for an insurance agency, where I continue to sharpen my communication and organizational abilities.</h3>
